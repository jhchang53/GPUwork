cross section library is in 4 parts

- fast neutron (72 G)
  using microblk
  
- thermal neutron (22 G)
  absorption cs (22G)
  scattering cs (22G)
  P0 matrix (22x22)
  P1 matrix (22x22)
  *  no fission


- gamma library (86 G)
  using microblk

- capture gammas
  num_gamline
  sig_2200
  sig_gprod

- kerma factors
  neutron kerma( 72+22G)
  gamma kerma (86G)

- gamma yield
  yield, energy (num_gamline)


microblk form
  = absorption xs	iwa	photoabsorption
  = fission xs		iwf     * NO fission is allowed
  = elastic xs		iws	photon Compton scattering
  = inelastic xs	la[0]
  = n2n xs		la[1]	photon pair-production
  = n3n xs		la[4]
  = inelastic cdf	lol[0]
  = inelastic anisotropy lol[2]   photon (pair-production)
  = n2n cdf    		lol[1]
  = n3n cdf    		lol[5]
  = elastic equal area xmu



fast group
 total cross sections
  tot_n = abs + elas + inel + n2n + n3n

  elastic 	- equal area xmu
  inelastic 	- cdf, anisotropy
  n2n		- n2n cdf (g->g')
  n3n		- n3n cdf

thermal group
  tot_th = absorption + scattering
  scattering - P0 matrix, P1 matrix

  absorption produce gamma yield


photon group
 total cross section
  tot_ph = abs + elas + pair(n2n)
  elas : sig    xmu is given but determined from Compton
  pair : sig    cdf is given but always to 512 keV (group 44)

  pair prod. cdf(energy)  - isotropic production
